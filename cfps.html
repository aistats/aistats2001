<h3>
Call for papers</h3>
This is the eighth in a series of workshops which have brought together
researchers in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and in Statistics to discuss
problems of mutual interest. The exchange has broadened research in both
fields and has strongly encouraged interdisciplinary work. Papers on all
aspects of the interface between AI &amp; Statistics are encouraged.
<p>To encourage interaction and a broad exchange of ideas, the presentations
will be limited to about 20 discussion papers in single session meetings
over three days (Jan. 5-7). Focused poster sessions will provide the means
for presenting and discussing the remaining research papers. Papers for
poster sessions will be treated equally with papers for presentation in
publications. Attendance at the workshop will not be limited.
<p>The three days of research presentations will be preceded by a day of
tutorials (Jan. 4). These are intended to expose researchers in each field
to the methodology and techniques used in other related areas.
<p>The Eighth workshop especially encourages submissions related to the
following workshop themes in the interface between information retrieval
and statistics:
<menu>
<li>
Statistical natural language processing</li>

<li>
Game theory</li>

<li>
Missing information; unlabeled examples</li>

<li>
Error correcting codes</li>
</menu>
In addition, papers on all aspects of the interface between AI &amp; Statistics
are strongly encouraged, including but not limited to
<menu>
<li>
Automated data analysis</li>

<li>
Cluster analysis and unsupervised learning</li>

<li>

<h4>
Submission Requirements:</h4>
Electronic submission of abstracts is required. The abstracts (up to 4
pages in length) should be submitted through the AI and Statistics Conference
Management page supported by Microsoft Research. More specific instructions
will be made available at&nbsp; <a href="http://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2001/">http://cmt.research.microsoft.com/AISTATS2001/</a>
<p>In special circumstances other arrangements can be made to facilitate
submission. For more information about possible arrangements, please contact
the conference chairs.
<p>Submissions will be considered if they are received by midnight July
10, 2000 (PST). Please indicate the theme and/or the topic(s) your abstract addresses.
Receipt of all submissions will be confirmed via electronic mail. Acceptance
notices will be emailed by September 1, 2000.

Due to the original extension of the submission deadline, and 
technical problems that have been encountered, 
acceptance decisions will now be announced in early
October.</font></font></center>


<p>Preliminary papers (up to 12 pages, double column) must be received
by November 1, 2000. These preliminary papers will be copied and distributed
at the workshop.
