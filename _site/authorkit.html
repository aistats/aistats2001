PROFESSIONAL BOOK CENTER - AI &amp; STATISTICS 2001 CONFERENCE
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2050 SOUTH SAINT PAUL ST., DENVER, CO 80210, U.S.A.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>To:&nbsp; All authors of accepted papers
<br>Congratulations on the acceptance of your paper for inclusion in the
AI &amp; Statistics 2001 proceedings. The following infor-
<br>mation is essential for preparing your final submission. IMPORTANT:
Due to schedule constraints, your papers must
<br>be delivered electronically. Please follow all instructions as closely
as possible.
<br>Submission Deadline and Mailing Instructions
<br>The deadline for receipt of your formatted paper via FTP, and the appropriate
accompanying forms via FAX (see below)
<br>is FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 10, by midnight (2400 hours) Eastern Daylight
Time. This is an absolute deadline; late pa-
<br>pers can not be included in the proceedings. If you discover major
errors in your paper following electronic submission,
<br>please contact us via e-mail (probook@sni.net) for permission and instructions
on how to submit a replacement paper.
<br>Although we will try to include replacement papers, we cannot guarantee
their inclusion in the book.
<br>We highly recommend that you transmit your file at least 48 to 72 hours
in advance of the deadline. Transient condi-
<br>tions, such as network downtime or inability to maintain a good connection,
may delay transmission. So if at all possible,
<br>please beat the deadline by a couple of days to allow yourself a margin
of error in case there is a problem.
<br>Length Requirements
<br>Each full paper should be no more than 8 pages in length; each poster
paper no more than 6 pages in length. If you
<br>find you must have more space, you may purchase up to 2 (two) additional
pages for a fee of $50 each to cover the
<br>additional production cost. Checks must be drawn on a U.S. bank, denominated
in U.S. dollars, and made payable to
<br>Professional Book Center. You may also pay by Visa/Mastercard. In either
case, you must complete the enclosed Extra
<br>Page Fee Invoice and return it with your paper. We cannot accept purchase
orders for payment of this fee. Any papers
<br>over the given length limit and not accompanied by the Extra Page Fee
Invoice will not be published.
<br>Prior/Duplicate Publication
<br>If your paper contains material (e.g., a figure) for which you have
transferred copyright to another party (e.g., a journal,
<br>publisher, or society), you will need to obtain permission from that
party to include the work in the proceedings. In this
<br>case, your paper should be accompanied by a copy of a written permission
from the journal, publisher, or society, and
<br>the appropriate credit information. Contact Jennifer Ballentine at
ProBook for information about obtaining copyright per-
<br>missions, if necessary. Note: if you publish an original paper in the
proceedings, this should not interfere with future
<br>publication.
<br>Permission to Publish Form
<br>Please print and sign the Permission to Publish form provided with
these materials, and FAX it to Professional Book Cen-
<br>ter (305-946-8106) in advance of the deadline. We will be unable to
publish your paper without this written consent.
<br>However, note that it is not a copyright transfer document-you and/or
the sponsors of your research retain all copy-
<br>rights in the work. Please be aware that only the lead author need
sign this form but he/she is signing it on behalf of all
<br>coauthors-check with your coauthors regarding copyright status of the
paper before signing the form. Please also com-
<br>plete the bottom portion of this form which shows how your name and
your coauthors' names should appear in the
<br>author index. Some names are quite straightforward (Smith, Jim); others
are not so obvious (van Dyke, Jim: alphabetized
<br>under ``V'' or ``D''? Epstein Barr, Sheila-or Barr, Sheila Epstein?).
<br>Extra Page Fee Invoice
<br>If your paper exceeds the limit established by the organizers, you
must also complete and FAX the Extra Page Fee
<br>Invoice along with the Permission to Publish form.
<br>Contacting Professional Book Center
<br>If you have any questions regarding formatting, deadlines, or electronic
submission of your paper, please contact Jennifer
<br>Ballentine at Professional Book Center: 303-756-5222, or send email
to probook@sni.net. Note that Professional Book
<br>Center is located in Colorado in the Mountain Time Zone-two hours earlier
(by the clock) than New York and one
<br>hour later than California. IMPORTANT: Due to the volume of proceedings
papers processed by Professional Book Cen-
<br>ter, we cannot individually confirm receipt of your materials. Please
DO NOT CALL or e-mail to inquire if your paper
<br>has been received. We will contact you if your materials were not received
by the deadline or are incomplete.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
PREPARING YOUR PAPER FOR ELECTRONIC DELIVERY-AI &amp; STATISTICS 2000
<p>Please read and follow the instructions below carefully:
<br>1.&nbsp; Prepare and review your paper exactly as if you intended to
physically send it to us. LaTEX macros for formatting
<br>your paper in the appropriate style are available from the conference
Web page:
<br>http://www.ai.mit.edu/conferences/aistats2001/authorkit.html.
<br>Special Note: Please use caps/lowercase style for your paper title-that
is, capitalize all important nouns, adjectives, and
<br>major verbs; use lowercase for minor verbs, prepositions, articles,
and conjunctions unless they begin the title or follow
<br>an internal colon or dash; use all uppercase only if necessary, for
example for acronyms.
<br>2.&nbsp; Once your paper is finalized, use your formatting software
to make a single PostScript, or preferably an Adobe Acro-
<br>bat PDF file for the entire paper. If you have the ability to make
a PDF file directly from LaTEX, we strongly encourage
<br>you to do so for reasons of file size and accuracy. Using Acrobat Distiller
to make a PDF file from your PostScript file is
<br>also possible (be sure to select the press option of Distiller). Whether
you will submit PostScript or PDF files, you must
<br>embed all fonts you use in your file (especially any math fonts, special
symbol fonts, or fonts you have created or cus-
<br>tomized yourself). Do not compress, zip, or encode your file in any
way. Make sure your file size is less than 3 mega-
<br>bytes (this will be much easier with a PDF file). When preparing graphics,
you may wish to downgrade scans or
<br>greyscale images to result in a final file size under 3 megabytes.
Please print and proofread your paper in its electronic
<br>form prior to submission; Professional Book Center will inspect your
paper for obvious errors, but printing your file di-
<br>rectly to a PostScript printer and checking the hard copy carefully
is your best check of accurate PostScripting. Do not
<br>e-mail the PostScript file: attachments frequently fail with files
of this size.
<br>3.&nbsp; Use the paper tracking number assigned by the organizers to
your accepted paper (e.g., kolmogorov1.pdf, kolmo-
<br>gorov2.pdf, etc.) as the filename, followed by the extension `.ps'
for a PostScript file or .pdf for a PDF file.
<br>4.&nbsp; Using your FTP client software, FTP your paper to ftp://ftp.ai.mit.edu/pub/incoming/aistat.
If you are not presently
<br>running FTP client software, we recommend the shareware program `ws_ftp'
which is available on the Web at
<br>`www.tucows.com'.
<br>5.&nbsp; After you've uploaded your contribution, please send an e-mail
message to `tommi@ai.mit.edu' and as well to
<br>`tsr@stat.washington.edu' with `AI &amp; STATISTICS 2001' on the subject
line, and include the following information: the
<br>name of the file that you uploaded, the names of the paper's authors,
the exact paper title, and the number of pages in
<br>the paper.
<br>6.&nbsp; If possible, please FTP your contribution early-papers may
be accepted right away. Early submission will also help
<br>avoid overburdening our server with large amounts of incoming data
arriving all at once on the deadline.
<br>7.&nbsp; You must FAX (to 305-946-8106) your completed Permission to
Publish form and (if applicable) the Extra Page Fee In-
<br>voice form. Both accompanying forms must be received by Professional
Book Center by the paper deadline.
<br>8.&nbsp; Following the conference, we would appreciate any feedback
or comment you have on this electronic delivery sys-
<br>tem. Your comments will be invaluable as we test, refine, and expand
the use of electronic tools in our production of
<br>conference materials. Please share your comments with us by e-mailing
probook@sni.net.
